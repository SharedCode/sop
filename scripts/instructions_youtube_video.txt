I can certainly help you build a "Director" script to automate the creation of this demo video.

Since SOP Data Manager has a Web UI, we can use Playwright (which you already use for tests) to:

Drive the Browser: automatically clicking buttons, typing prompts, and navigating the wizard.
Record Video: Capture the browser viewport pixel-perfectly.
Sync Narration: We can pause execution at key moments to allow the Voiceover to finish before moving to the next action.
For the "Download & Terminal" section, since Playwright only controls the browser, I will include a "simulated terminal" segment in the script that types out the commands in a realistic way (using Python's sys.stdout), which you can capture with a standard screen recorder, or we can focus the automation on the rich Web UI part.

Here is a complete automation suite.

Step 1: Install Dependencies
You will need gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for the placeholder audio, and ffmpeg (usually installed) to combine them.

(Mutagen is used to check audio file duration for syncing).

Step 2: Create the Director Script
I'll create scripts/produce_demo.py. This script acts as the "Director". It launches the app, starts recording, talks through the features, and executes the actions.

Created produce_demo.py

Yes, it is definitely possible to automate this!

I have created a starter script for you in produce_demo.py that demonstrates how to build this "Video Factory".

How it works:
"Director" Engine: It uses Playwright to drive the browser (Setup Wizard, AI Copilot, etc.) and records the session to a .webm video file.
Narrator: It uses a Text-to-Speech library (gTTS is suggested/mocked in the script) to "speak" the narration.
Synchronization: The script types text slowly (like a human) and sleeps for the duration of the narration lines, ensuring the video matches the audio timing.
Prerequisites to run this:
You will need to install a few python libraries and have ffmpeg (optional, for final assembly):

What you need to customize:
The script I generated contains placeholder selectors (like #start-wizard-btn, textarea[name='prompt']). You will need to inspect your actual Web UI (Right-click -> Inspect) and update the selectors in produce_demo.py to match your real IDs/Classes.

Regarding the "Download & Unpack" part:
Playwright is specialized for the Web Browser parts (Setup Wizard, AI Copilot).
To automate the Terminal part (downloading, unzipping, chmod), you have two options:

Separate Recording: Record that part manually with QuickTime/OBS and stitch it to the beginning.
Terminal Recorder: Use a tool like asciinema or terminalizer to script a "fake" terminal session that types out the commands for you.
If you specifically want "Gemini" generated audio (instead of the standard Google Translate voice), you would just swap the gTTS call in the search_webpage function with a call to the Vertex AI API (if you have an active GCP project).
