// Package verify checks a finite operational workflow (a runbook: a set of
// steps with preconditions and postconditions) against two classes of
// property before letting an agent execute a step:
//
//   - Safety (precedence): a forbidden state must never occur unless a
//     required state occurred first. Example: "the production database can
//     never be dropped unless a backup was already validated."
//   - Reachability: a target state must remain reachable from wherever
//     execution currently stands. Example: "a rollback path must always
//     exist, even after a partial failure."
//
// What this is: an explicit-state graph checker over a finite workflow.
// Safety checking is the "P is preceded by Q" pattern from Dwyer, Avrunin,
// and Corbett's property specification patterns (1999), the same
// specification family most LTL model checkers verify against; here it's
// checked directly against an accumulated state set rather than compiled
// into a temporal-logic formula and run through a model checker. Reachability
// checking is plain graph reachability (BFS) over the step graph.
//
// What this is not: a general-purpose LTL/CTL model checker. There is no
// temporal-operator parser, no Büchi automaton construction, no support for
// infinite-trace properties or probabilistic model checking. For a finite
// runbook with an enumerable set of states, that generality isn't needed to
// get a correct answer, an explicit precondition/postcondition graph is
// exactly the right level of formalism, and a much smaller trusted
// computing base to verify by reading the source.
