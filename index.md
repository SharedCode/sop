# SOP: one engine for data and compute

SOP is an ACID-compliant B-Tree storage engine with a distributed coordination model built in. It runs embedded in your process on a laptop, and the same code scales out to a cluster that shares storage and coordination state. No separate database server to operate.

```
go run ./examples/quickstart
```

## Why it matters

- **ACID transactions on a B-Tree engine.** Ordered keys, ranged scans, and transactional writes in one library.
- **Erasure coding instead of replication.** Storage-efficient fault tolerance built into the file system layer.
- **Swarm computing.** Applications coordinate as one system: work distribution and failover come from the platform, not glue code.
- **Polyglot by design.** One Go core, bindings for Python (`pip install sop4py`), C# (`dotnet add package Sop`), Java and Rust in progress.
- **AI-ready.** Ships with a Data Manager, script runtime, and an embedded copilot for conversational data ops.
