# SOP V2 Release v2.2.4: The Data & Compute Platform Era

We are thrilled to announce **SOP v2.2.4**, a major milestone that transforms SOP from a high-performance transactional storage engine into a comprehensive **Data & Compute Platform**. This release focuses on developer experience, AI-assisted operations, and unifying our ecosystem.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 🖥️ SOP Data Manager
**Data Visualization & Management for the Modern Era**
The new SOP Data Manager serves as the command center for your data. It combines a robust **RESTful API** with a modern **Single Page Application (SPA) WebUI** to give you full visibility and control over your B-Tree stores.
*   **Visual Management**: Inspect stores, monitoring registry tables, and visualize data structures in real-time.
*   **Visual Script Studio**: A complete Visual Development Environment (IDE-lite) for authoring, updating, and managing automation scripts directly within the browser.
*   **Flexible Workflows**: Seamlessly supports both **Code-First** (manage schema via struct) and **Data-First** (manage schema via UI) development paradigms.
*   **Universal Access**: Operates across local instances, clustered environments, and edge deployments.

### 🤖 SOP AI Copilot
**Self-Correcting Data Administration**
Say goodbye to complex CLI commands and manual configuration. The SOP AI Copilot introduces a natural language interface for database administration.
*   **Natural Language Operations**: "Create a new user store with 10k items" – Copilot translates your intent into precise system actions.
*   **Self-Correcting Capability**: The AI monitors command execution, detects errors (e.g., syntax, missing parameters), and automatically corrections itself to ensure the task is completed successfully.
*   **LLM-Guided Workflows**: Lowers the barrier to entry for complex administration tasks by acting as an always-on expert assistant.

### 📜 Intelligent Scripting Engine
**Automation Bridge: From AI to Production**
We bridge the gap between AI generation and production reliability.
*   **Captured Instructions**: The engine captures the successful tool instructions generated by the AI Copilot.
*   **Trusted Execution**: These instructions are compiled into deterministic scripts that can be executed in production environments **without human or LLM intervention**, ensuring speed, reliability, and security.

### 📦 Unified Versioning (v2.2.4)
**One Version to Rule Them All**
We have synchronized the entire SOP ecosystem. No more matrix of compatibility checks.
*   **Unified Release**: The Go Server, Python bindings, C# Client, Java library, and Rust implementation now all share the **v2.2.4** tag.
*   **Rich Versioning**: Improved semantic versioning across all package managers (PyPI, NuGet, Maven, Cargo).

### 💿 Easy Installation
*   **Downloadable Installer**: Getting started is easier than ever with our new streamlined installer for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
*   **Zero-Config Bundle**: The release bundle includes the Data Manager, Server, and CLI tools pre-configured for immediate use.
