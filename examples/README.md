# SOP Go Examples

This directory contains example applications demonstrating various features of Scalable Objects Persistence (SOP) in Go.

## 🌍 Interoperability & Polyglot Usage

SOP is designed to be a polyglot database. To ensure data written in Go can be read by Python, C#, Java, or Rust (and vice versa), you should use the `jsondb` package. This provides **symmetry** across all language bindings.

### 1. Basic Interop (`interop_jsondb`)
Demonstrates how to store Go structs so they are automatically serialized to the "Universal" JSON format.
- **Key Feature**: `jsondb.NewJsonBtree[K, V]`
- **Why**: Ensures your data is accessible to AI models in Python or services in C#.

### 2. Secondary Indexes (`interop_secondary_indexes`)
Demonstrates "Schema-less" storage with composite secondary indexes.
- **Key Feature**: `jsondb.NewJsonBtreeMapKey` + `IndexSpecification`
- **Why**: Allows you to define sorting rules (e.g., "Sort by Category ASC, then Price DESC") that are respected by all language bindings.
- **New**: Also includes `struct_key_main.go` demonstrating `jsondb.NewJsonBtreeStructKey` for a more idiomatic Go experience using structs as keys.

## 🚀 High-Performance Native Go

For pure Go microservices where you don't need to share data with other languages, you can use the native generic API.

### 3. Swarm Computing (`swarm_standalone` & `swarm_clustered`)
Demonstrates SOP's ability to handle concurrent transactions from multiple threads (or processes) without external locks.
- **Key Feature**: `database.NewBtree[K, V]` (Native)
- **Scenario**: 40 concurrent threads updating the same B-Tree.
- **Variants**:
    - `swarm_standalone`: Runs on local disk.
    - `swarm_clustered`: Runs on Redis (simulating a distributed cluster).

## 🏢 Multi-Tenancy & Configuration

### 4. Multi-Redis (`multi_redis_url`)
Demonstrates connecting to multiple Redis databases (e.g., DB 0 and DB 1) in the same application using the standard URL format.
- **Key Feature**: `RedisCacheConfig.URL` (`redis://host:port/db`)

## ▶️ Running the Examples

You can run all examples in sequence using the suite script in the root directory:

```bash
./run_go_suite.sh
```

Or run individual examples:

```bash
go run examples/interop_jsondb/main.go
```
